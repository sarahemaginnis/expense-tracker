# expense-tracker

This is my first react project, done in part with the Udemy course on React, "React: The Complete Guide" (https://warbyparker.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

This is a simple expense tracker app that taught me the basics of React and working with components, React State and working with events, as well as rendering lists and conditional content.
